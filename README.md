# super-resolution-mapping
1.	Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2.	The input image should be available in a known directory.
3.	The uigetfile function allows selecting an image file manually. If no image is selected, the script uses a default image path.
a.	Open MATLAB and create a new script (.m file).
b.	Copy and paste the provided code into the script.
c.	Save the script with a relevant name, such as simmap1.m.
d.	Run the script by pressing the Run button in MATLAB or typing the function in the command window:
e.	Select an image when prompted, or the script will use the default image 
4.	Enter the mapping window size when prompted. This determines the resolution of the output image.Convert the image to grayscale and normalize pixel values.
5.	Initialize a mapping using an artificial neural network-like structure.
6.	Apply transformation and iteration to refine the pixel classification.
7.	Display intermediate images and final processed output.
8.	Save the final processed image using MATLABâ€™s imsave function.
